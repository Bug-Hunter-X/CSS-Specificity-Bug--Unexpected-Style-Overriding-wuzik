To solve this, several approaches can be used. We can increase the specificity of the `p` rule, override it with `!important` (generally discouraged), or restructure the CSS to minimize conflicts.  In this case, the most elegant solution might involve using a more specific selector for the desired styling.

Here's an example of how to solve it using a more specific selector: 
```css
/* solution.css */
.box { 
  width: 300px; 
  border: 1px solid black; 
}

p { 
  color: blue;
}
.box p { 
  color: red; 
}

/* Added more specific selector */
.box > p { /* direct child of .box */ 
  color: green; 
}
```
